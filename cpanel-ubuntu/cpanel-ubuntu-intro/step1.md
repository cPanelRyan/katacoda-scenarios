#  Getting the hang of it

Working with a user interface like _Ubuntu Desktop_, _Fedora_, or other, major consumer-focused Linux distributions can be a good introduction to working with Linux, as you inevitably will find yourself interacting with the terminal for one reason or another.

Operating from the command-line brings you "closer" to the fundamental operations of the system itself, which is why it also happens to be an excellent means of both learning, as well as administering, a server environment.

For the purposes of our exercises, we're going to look at this from the perspective of an administrator seeking to operate a **web hosting environment** through the use of **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS**, which, in its ideal (minimal) initial state, provides _only_ the use of the command-line interface, with no assistance from a graphical user interface.

# So what separates Ubuntu from the rest?

Let's start from the beginning:

> Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on **Debian**.

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/), if you're not familiar, is an even older Linux distribution that established one of the handful of authoritative distributions of Linux used as the foundation of numerous other platforms, including MacOS (which is why the Mac terminal offers many familiar operations, for those already comfortable with Linux).

> **FYI**: The word **ubuntu** is part of the Zulu phrase "_Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu_", which literally means that a person is a person through other people.

This means that, like many open-source efforts over history, Ubuntu was - for all intents and purposes - established when someone decided to make a copy of the Debian source code so that they could make their own changes, eventually evolving into a large enough scale project that it warranted establishing itself as its own product entirely. This property is currently owned and managed by an organization called [Canonical](https://canonical.com/).

Ubuntu gets new stable releases about once every two years, with the most recent being released on April 23rd, 2020: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ("Focal Fossa").

> **FYI**: Ubuntu version numbers are modeled in a simple YY.MM format (above example being 20.04, because it was released in April of 2020).

20.04 is the version we'll be looking at specifically, here. LTS, in this context, indicates "Long-term support", which just means that you can expect to be able to run this version stably for quite some time.

Tired of the history lesson? Lucky for you, that's about all we're going to look at. Let's start playing around with it.
